faq:
  - q: What is the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project?
    a: >-
      It’s a plan to import cheap natural gas from Iran to Pakistan through a

Some countries have huge amounts of gas and oil. Russia, Iran, and Qatar have the most natural gas, while Saudi Arabia and Canada hold the largest oil reserves. Iran is rich in both and shares a 900-kilometer border with Pakistan.  

Pakistan has faced gas and oil shortages for years. Even as a nuclear power, these shortages hurt the economy. In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto started talks to buy cheap gas from Iran and signed an agreement with Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani. Her government fell in 1996, and the project was delayed.  

In 2008, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani revived the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline plan. They wanted cheap fuel from Iran but also good relations with the US, which opposed the deal due to sanctions. Saudi Arabia was also against it. Zardari, with China’s help, worked to ease tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. In 2013, Zardari and Iranian President Ahmadinejad inaugurated the project.  

When Nawaz Sharif took office, he stayed silent on the plan under pressure and bought gas from Qatar instead. Imran Khan also refused to cancel the project but did not move it forward. One big reason no government ended it was public backlash over fuel prices — dropping the project would anger citizens. The second reason was legal: the agreement included an international court in France as the arbitrator. Backing out would cost Pakistan at least $18 billion.  

The agreement began in 1995, was launched in 2009, and inaugurated in 2013, with a 2024 completion deadline. When Shahbaz Sharif became PM in 2022, Pakistan was facing a serious economic crisis and needed US-friendly policies for IMF support, so the project stayed on hold.  

In March 2023, China helped Iran and Saudi Arabia restore relations. This raised hopes for progress. In May 2023, Pakistan signed a deal to buy cheap electricity from Iran, but the US warned that buying gas would trigger sanctions. Pakistan delayed again, while Iran grew impatient. Iran had already built its part of the pipeline and, by March 2024, gave Pakistan a legal notice.  

Media reported Pakistan could now owe Iran $18 billion. While Pakistan prepared for legal action, Israel attacked Iran. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia then backed Iran diplomatically, improving relations. Recently, Iranian President Dr. Masoud Peshkian told PM Shahbaz Sharif that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had stopped legal action, urging talks instead. A committee led by Ishaq Dar is now working on it.  

If talks fail, the case will return to the French court, and Pakistan could face the massive fine. The big question: will the US pay if Pakistan loses? The government raises fuel prices often, angering the public — so why not bring in cheap gas, petrol, and electricity from Iran? If US sanctions are the fear, Pakistan must decide: protect pride or risk an $18 billion penalty.
