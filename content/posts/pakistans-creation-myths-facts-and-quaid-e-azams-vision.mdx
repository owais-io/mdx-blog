tldr:
  - >-
    Some in India believe Pakistan was created by British and American powers as
    part of a geopolitical plan, citing that Muslim League leaders were never
    jailed.
  - >-
    Historical facts show several Muslim League leaders, including its
    presidents, were jailed, though Jinnah avoided arrest by following a legal
    and constitutional approach.
  - >-
    Quaid-e-Azam’s vision for equal rights and resistance to injustice is still
    relevant today, but modern Pakistan has strayed from those principles.
faq:
  - q: Did any Muslim League leaders go to jail during the Pakistan Movement?
    a: >-
      Yes, leaders like Maulana Muhammad Ali Johar and Maulana Hasrat Mohani,
      both former presidents of the All India Muslim League, were jailed
      multiple times.
  - q: Why was Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah never arrested?
    a: >-
      Jinnah chose a constitutional and legal path for political struggle,
      avoiding civil disobedience movements that often led to arrests.
  - q: Was Pakistan’s creation a Western conspiracy?
    a: >-
      Some Indian writers claim it was, but historical evidence shows Pakistan
      emerged from a political struggle led by leaders with varying approaches,
      not solely due to foreign intervention.
  - q: What was Jinnah’s stance on global issues like Palestine?
    a: >-
      In 1947, Jinnah opposed the UN’s plan to partition Palestine and warned US
      President Truman that creating Israel would not bring peace to the Middle
      East.
  - q: Has Pakistan followed Quaid-e-Azam’s vision?
    a: >-
      In many ways, no — laws and political practices today often contradict his
      principles of equality, justice, and constitutional governance.

Some people are of the view — especially many in India — that the creation of Pakistan was a British and American plan to block the Soviet Union’s path in South Asia. They believe that Western powers made Pakistan and point to claims from books like *History That India Ignored* by Prem Prakash, which cites leaders like Wali Khan and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. According to this view, no leader of the All India Muslim League, including Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was ever arrested during the Pakistan Movement, which they see as proof of this “conspiracy.”

The fact is, while Quaid-e-Azam himself was never arrested, several Muslim League leaders were. For example, Maulana Muhammad Ali Johar — once president of the All India Muslim League — was elected to this position while in jail. His wife, Amjadi Bano, led the League’s women’s wing and was the first to call the Lahore Resolution the “Pakistan Resolution.” Similarly, Maulana Hasrat Mohani, another League president, went to jail many times.

Jinnah’s own approach was different. He opposed laws like the Rowlatt Act in 1918, even resigning from the assembly in protest, but he believed in staying within legal and constitutional limits rather than leading street protests. This is why he did not join Congress’s 1942 Civil Disobedience Movement — the action that got Gandhi, Nehru, and others arrested. Later, Lord Mountbatten even offered him the post of Prime Minister of a united India, but Jinnah insisted on Pakistan, believing that Congress would create a Hindu-majority rule harmful to Muslims — a fear later events in India have, in the eyes of many, confirmed.

Quaid-e-Azam was also clear-sighted about global issues. In 1947, he rejected the UN’s plan to partition Palestine and warned US President Truman that creating Israel would never bring peace to the Middle East. Sadly, while he built Pakistan to protect people’s rights, today similar unjust laws to the Rowlatt Act exist here, where dissent can bring imprisonment without trial. Ironically, speeches attacking Jinnah go unpunished, while his own vision — like his August 11, 1947 address declaring equal rights for all citizens — was once censored, though now officially recognized.

We broke Quaid-e-Azam’s Pakistan, yet even people in today’s Bangladesh — once part of it — still proudly raise the slogan: *Pakistan Zindabad*.
